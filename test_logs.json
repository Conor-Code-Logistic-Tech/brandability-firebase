All opposed goods have some level of similarity to the opponent's goods, ranging from identical (Class 3) to low (Class 18). The marks have a high degree of visual similarity, differing only by the letter 'R' and a border. Aurally, they are considered to have a medium to high degree of similarity depending on pronunciation. Conceptually, while some may see them as distinct misspellings of 'straight' and 'state', a significant proportion will see them as meaningless strings of characters, making them conceptually neutral. Given the identical goods, the high similarity of the marks, the medium distinctiveness of the earlier mark, and the medium level of consumer attention, a likelihood of direct confusion is found. Consumers are likely to overlook the minor differences and presume the marks originate from the same undertaking."}}

For a significant proportion of consumers, the marks are conceptually neutral, perceived simply as strings of characters. These factors, combined with the medium inherent distinctiveness of the earlier mark, mean consumers are likely to overlook the minor differences (the letter 'R' and the border) and presume the marks originate from the same or economically-linked undertakings, even when paying a medium level of attention."}}
